# Zerda Engine

## Note from the developer, Ashlynn Juniper (December 30, 2023)

The Zerda Engine and Zerda Programming Language are labors of love made by a woman frustrated by over a decade of programming,
satisfied by no language which she's tried as of writing.
The programming language will have a pleasant, high-level syntax,
as well as built-in performance-boosting features.
The engine itself will be optimized for performance and will take advantage of hardware acceleration wherever possible.
Lastly, I'm going to try something experimental and aim to make use of the Entity-Component-System (ECS) paradigm
as opposed to the standard Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.

If you enjoy this engine or find it useful, please consider supporting my work!
I live almost entirely off of rice and frozen vegetables because I can't afford anything more expensive.
People are not meant to starve!!

## Design Goals

Zerda is designed:

* To be portable, supporting all major desktop platforms, mobile devices, and consoles.
* To be beginner-friendly by providing an easy-to-learn, high-level syntax.
* To be veteran-friendly by providing hardware acceleration methods in the standard library (GPU, SIMD, threads, etc.).
* To be very error-resistant by enforcing certain rules at the syntactic level.
* To generate platform-optimized code in order to achieve blazingly-fast performance.
* To allow for both static and dynamic typing.
* To write dynamically-typed prototypes and then optimize by specifying the types of existing dynamic variables.
* To transpile to either C++, TypeScript, or JavaScript.
* To take advantage of any hardware present in order to maximize performance.
